# Code
🧠 Deep Learning Concepts Used

Transfer Learning:
Used VGG16 pretrained weights to transfer learned image features to forest dataset.

Feature Extraction:
Frozen lower convolutional layers to use as feature extractors.

Fine-Tuning:
Unfrozen top layers of VGG16 to adapt to the new forest dataset.

Custom CNN Layers:
Added additional convolutional, pooling, and dense layers for deeper feature learning.

ANN (Artificial Neural Network):
Introduced adversarial training to improve model generalization across different forest domains or lighting conditions.

Classification Head:
Used fully connected layers and softmax for final prediction between categories (e.g., dense forest, dry forest, deforested area).

# 🎯 Purpose

This project demonstrates how transfer learning can significantly reduce training time and improve accuracy on limited datasets.
It also shows how domain adaptation (DANN) and fine-tuning can enhance model performance on varied forest environments.

# 📚 Future Enhancements

🌍 Integrate satellite imagery (Sentinel, Landsat)

📦 Use ResNet50, EfficientNet, or ViT for comparison

🧠 Deploy model as a REST API using FastAPI or Flask

📊 Add Grad-CAM visualization to interpret model predictions
